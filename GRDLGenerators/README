principal code that makes the histograms from trees.
The way to use this code is to do:
make compile, and do

mv main dogrl
./dogrl tree1.root

to run.


In order to run over a big list of data, the idea is to do a list.txt with 
all the trees and add at the begining of each 
line 

./dogrl tree1.root
./dogrl tree2.root
./dogrl tree3.root
./dogrl tree4.root

being dogrl a copy of the binary main, but dogrl yields at the same folder as 
the data.
Then we must to change the list.txt by list.sh, and change the permissions
by

chmod ug+x list.sh

after that we could run by making

nohup ./list.sh &

and click enter twice.
Depending of the output registered in nohup.out after have run the project,
we could rename this file as 

mv nohup.out grl<DETECTOR><YEAR>.txt
